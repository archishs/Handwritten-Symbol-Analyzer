# Handwritten Symbol Analyzer
This program takes any handwritten symbols from the set it has been trained on and outputs the probability of its predictions on a graph. The training data used in the example is from the Sklearn handwritten symbols dataset. You can replace the training and testing data in the program.

## Instructions
1. Make sure you have python 3, pyplot from matplotlib and pandas on your computer
